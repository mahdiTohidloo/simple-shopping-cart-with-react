## Simple Shopping Cart With React.js

A simple to show products, add them to shopping cart, remove them and change the quantity of products
in the shopping cart. 
I've used `React Hooks` and `Context API` to implement the project

 
All you need to run this project is: 

- Download the project
- run ` npm install`
- run `npm start`

And you can see it on `localhost:3000`. Hope to enjoy it. 
Feel free to contribute :)
